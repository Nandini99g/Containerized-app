Host --> Compose : start
Compose --> Build : build .
Build --> Image
Image --> Container : run
Container --> AppCode : executes
CI --> Image : build & push
CI --> Host : runs container for verification (8080:5000)

note bottom
  NOTE: README mentions 8080 but compose uses 8090.\nConfirm which host port is intended.
